Two proofs of work (POWs) are utilized for each block validation process. Initially, the block undergoes verification using the Yespower algorithm. Subsequently, the same block is subjected to two rounds of SHA512 with a salt, followed by two rounds of Argon2id. The block is deemed valid only if it passes both proof of work validations simultaneously.

For the Yespower proof of work, the function GetYespowerPowHash() computes the hash. This function serializes the block data and utilizes the Yespower algorithm for hash computation.

For the Argon2id proof of work, the function GetArgon2idPoWHash() is employed. This function serializes the block data and then performs two rounds of SHA512 hashing with a salt. Following this, it conducts two rounds of Argon2id hashing. The resulting hash from the second round is returned.

To verify block headers, the function CheckBlockHeader() is utilized. It evaluates both proofs of work for the block. If either proof of work fails, the block is considered invalid.

For lightweight Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, only one of the proof of works can be utilized for verification. Typically, the combination of SHA512 and Argon2id is recommended due to its efficiency and wide availability across different platforms.
