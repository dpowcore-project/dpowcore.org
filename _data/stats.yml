## Size of the Dpowcoin Core data directory running with default settings.

## Size of the datadir with the maximum allowed pruning enabled.
## Suggest rounding up a little bit to give room for growth in the UTXO

## Size of monthly increase in datadir size.  For 1 MB blocks, 288
## blocks per day, 30 days per month, 1000 MB/GB: 1*288*30/1000 = 8.64 GB.
## Rounding that up to 9 GB and assuming it could quickly double with
## increased segwit adoption gives a range of 9 to 18 GB/month.
